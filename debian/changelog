haskell-debian (3.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a --ghc-version option to specify what the ghc version is in the
    build environment, in case it is different from the one where the
    autobuilder is being run.  This affects what packages cabal-debian
    thinks are built into the compiler.  I have non-working code to actually
    look in the environment for this information, but it depends on having
    the compiler already installed there.
  * Greatly sped-up cabal-debian.
  * Add --build-dep to specify extra build dependencies.
  * Generate a haskell-packagename-utils deb with all the executables, rather
    than one deb per executable.

haskell-debian (3.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-order generated dependencies so we are more likely to build
    with newer packages installed.

haskell-debian (3.56-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * I created a new repository by importing the sid version of
    haskell-debian-3.55 and then applying my patches.  This is because
    I don't understand why Marco's repository is so different from the
    code in sid.  At some point we will get this all sorted out.
